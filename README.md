# csscube
An animated 3x3x3 "Rubik's&trade;" cube with only html and css.

The goal of this project is to provide a set of html files that can be used to visualize cube solving tutorials without using images or JavaScript.

Other goals are:
- As little browser-specific css as possible;
- Works on all modern browsers, no effort in supporting very old browsers;

The following features are implemented:
- Active/inactive cubies;
- Animations;
- Rotation of either the whole cube or single layers/cubies;
- Text (single character) on cubes;
- Central colors/styling via css variables (partial);
- Rotation preview with hover/touch.
- Generate code with script

ToDo:
- Improve performance;
- Shadows to show colors of hidden cubes;
- Unique 'csscube-' naming of css classes/ids.

At this moment, the project is still in development, so expect some big changes and/or rewrites.

The latest version is always available here:
